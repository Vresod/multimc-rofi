# MultiMC-Rofi

the missing component for a multimc user's `rofi`.

this project is only useful for a very small amount of people. this group is the intersection of:

- people who use MultiMC
- people who use a window manager with rofi

# To use

to use this program, put `multimc-rofi.py` in either `/usr/bin/` or anywhere else in your path rename it to `multimc-instance-picker`. if you use drun with rofi, a .desktop file is provided (although it needs to be modified to be usable). put this in either `/usr/share/applications` or `~/.local/share/applications`.
